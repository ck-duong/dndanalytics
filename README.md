Dungeons and Dragons(DND) is a fantasy Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) published by Wizards of the Coast. DND utilize "character sheets", a record of a player character's (PC) stats, abilities, and so on. Character sheets are unique to each individual PC, and a character's information is influenced by their class, background, race, etc.
